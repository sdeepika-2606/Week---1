# Week---1
“Week 1 Submission: E-Waste Generation Classification – Initial Setup, Problem Statement, Dataset Research”
# 🌍 E-Waste Image Classification using EfficientNetV2B0 (Transfer Learning)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project addresses the pressing environmental challenge of e-waste management. Using **EfficientNetV2B0** and **transfer learning**, the model classifies images of discarded electronics into 10 categories to aid automated recycling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an image classification model using transfer learning.
- Leverage EfficientNetV2B0 for optimal accuracy and performance.
- Deploy the model using **Gradio** for interactive testing.
