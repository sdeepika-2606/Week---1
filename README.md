# E-Waste Generation Using ResNet50 for Sustainable Recycling Solutions

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to classify various types of e-waste (e.g., PCB, mobile, mouse, battery, etc.) using the ResNet50 deep learning model via transfer learning. The goal is to build an automated image classification system to support sustainable e-waste management.

## 📦 Week 1 Milestone

### ✅ Improvisations Done
- Chose ResNet50 instead of EfficientNet for balanced accuracy and speed.
- Prepared a structured dataset and resized/normalized images.
- Designed a clear project workflow and process flowchart.
- Built model structure and evaluated model selection strategies.
- Created a working Gradio UI (optional for now).
